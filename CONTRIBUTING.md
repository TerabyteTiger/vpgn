# Contribution Guide

## Issues

If you'd like to claim an issue, please comment on the issue claiming it. 

If you think of a feature that isn't currently an issue, please submit an issue outlining the change/feature you'd like to make before starting to work on it to prevent any overlapping work or unneeded work. 

Hacktoberfest specific: If an issue is claimed and no update has been received for 7 days, feel free to ask if the original claiming user (tag them) is still working on it. If no response is received in 2 days I will reassign the issue to you.
